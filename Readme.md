# Data Cleaning in Python

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts and notebooks for data cleaning tasks. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that datasets are accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis or machine learning. This collection covers common data cleaning techniques using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-cleaning-python.git
cd data-cleaning-python
```

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Navigate to the `scripts` or `notebooks` directory to find various data cleaning scripts and Jupyter notebooks. Each script or notebook focuses on a specific data cleaning task and provides explanations along with code comments.

To run a script, use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

To open a Jupyter notebook, use:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
```

Make sure to adjust paths and filenames according to your dataset.

## Examples

### 1. Handling Missing Values

The script `handle_missing_values.py` demonstrates techniques for handling missing values in a dataset using Pandas. It covers methods such as dropping missing values, imputing values, and more.

### 2. Removing Duplicates

The notebook `remove_duplicates.ipynb` provides a step-by-step guide on identifying and removing duplicate rows from a dataset using Pandas.

### 3. Data Type Conversion

In the script `convert_data_types.py`, you will find examples of converting data types of columns to the appropriate format using Pandas.
